# POSIXLIB
POSIX library in an all in one header file(STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS)
Only supports the ctype header as of right now but i might to add more.

Purpose of this is to have the power of the posix library in one header file because i just would like to have an all in one package.
A header file that has everything you would need and you dont need to include multiple headers which can be really annoying.
